## overview
this project can reflect how to solve a serious problem in life only with going online using available tech solution.
the idea is to make the data gathering of people easy for both goverment and individuals(who are authorized) and that solves many problems in counting, predicting or even planning skiping a lot of steps of checking the reliablitiy of the data

## building plan
- first step is the user research(which is skipped here because this is a demo)
- wireframing and prototyping
- making the block diagram to know what are the functionality needed
- implemeting the functionality using typeScript on nextJs for front end and python on Django for backEnd(if needed)
- styling using tailwind css
- refactoring
